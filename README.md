#Created_simple_ToDo_list
 I developed a basic to-do list application using Java for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend .

1. Designed the user interface using HTML and
style it with CSS for a simple and intuitive
layout.
2. Implemented backend functionality using Java
Servlets or Spring Boot to handle CRUD
operations for tasks.
3. Connected the frontend and backend using
AJAX or Fetch API to enable dynamic
updating of tasks without page refresh.
